# Compound Components

Demonstrates a refactoring of a YuckyMenu into a DeliciousMenu by employing the
React Compound Components pattern along with some other patterns.

Still a bit rough around the edges.

React Compound Components is a pattern that can be employed to create composable components that can 
share some state. 

It promotes:

- Loosely coupled lightweight components.
- Flexibility in regards to customisation of styles, rendering behaviour.
- A better developer experience, more comprehendible. 
- Reuse of existing components.
